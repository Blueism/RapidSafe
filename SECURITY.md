## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a security bug or vulnerability rises we ask you do not tell anyone and report to us right away:

**Why?** 

*This is because people will try to exploit that vulnerability and take the advantage, this is why we ask you only report it to us, In a safe & secure way.*

**So, where do I go?**

*We ask that you contact us, through a discord server or through email which will all be listed in the front page.*

**What should I expect?**

*You should expect and understand that we may accept or decline your vulnerability, if it is a direct security vulnerability then we will accept it, however if it
isn't we will decline it, we also want to say you should not expect pay at all, we did not hire you to find vulnerabilities. You are just a user of our product.*
